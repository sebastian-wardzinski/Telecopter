Setup:

For camera stablization, put "settings.json" in one of the following areas:
https://github.com/Microsoft/AirSim/blob/master/docs/settings.md#where-are-settings-stored

Personally, I put it in my "Documents\AirSim" folder.

The main control scheme is "controlsFPV_Overlay.py". Download the file and run in on your computer after starting up AirSim. Most packages can be installed using "pip install" using their normal name, one exception is "win32gui" which should be install under "pywin32". They may be more exceptions I don't remember.
